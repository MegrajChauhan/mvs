/*
 * The format will look something like this:
 * <IDENTIFICATION[Magic Numbers]> <ENDIANNESS OF THE INSTRUCTIONS AND DATA> ->
 * Identification Header[We will have a few bytes left to be used for something
 * else if it comes to that] 
 * <Instruction Section Length> The length of the instruction section 
 * <Data Section Length> The number of bytes that the Data Section has 
 * <Debugging Information Table Length> -> A custom section
 *
 * <Instruction Section>
 * <Data Section>
 * <Debugging Information>: [None of Merry's business]
 *
 * A detailed explanation for each of the sections is as follow:
 * Data Section: Contains all of the data needed by the core.
 * DI: This section is a sort of "do-what-you-will" section.
 * As Merry is planned to provide a debugging framework which may be utilized by
 * people to write debuggers. For this case,
 * people may come up with conventions as to how this section should be
 * structured. Based on those standards and conventions, assemblers and
 * compilers may produce the necessary information. Thus, this is a customizable
 * section.
 *
 * The header and the lengths will all be in big endian format. The
 * instructions and data will all follow the endianness of the host
 * where they were generated.
 *
 * The reader will provide the read instructions and data and it is upto the
 * memory to structure it as it sees fit
 * */
